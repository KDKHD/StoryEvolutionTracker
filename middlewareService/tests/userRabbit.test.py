      "text": "[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nTwo days after a 22-year-old woman with her 1-year-old daughter in a stroller fell down the steps of a Manhattan subway station, the city\u2019s medical examiner suggested that the woman\u2019s death was not caused by the fall but \u201cappears to be related to a pre-existing medical condition.\u201d\n\nThe chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, did not provide details but said \u201cno significant trauma\u201d was involved in the death of the woman, Malaysia Goodson. She said the cause of Ms. Goodson\u2019s death had not yet been determined. Ms. Goodson\u2019s daughter Rhylee, who was tucked in the stroller, survived.\n\nMalaysia had been healthy all her life, including the past year after the birth of Rhylee, Tamika Goodson, her mother, said. She said she was awaiting word on an autopsy. \u201cI need to know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out. If there\u2019s anything, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d\n\nWhatever the circumstances that resulted in Ms. Goodson ending up at the bottom of the stairs, her death shaped an anguished dialogue about life in New York City \u2014 about how people so rarely offer to lend a hand to those with strollers, about how so many subway stations lack elevators, about how the elevators in stations that have them are so often broken and about how the limitations of the city\u2019s old and creaking transportation system create obstacles, not just for people with small children but for older passengers and people with disabilities.",

      "text": "[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]\n\nTwo days after a 22-year-old woman with her 1-year-old daughter in a stroller fell down the steps of a Manhattan subway station, the city\u2019s medical examiner suggested that the woman\u2019s death was not caused by the fall but \u201cappears to be related to a pre-existing medical condition.\u201d\n\nThe chief medical examiner, Dr. Barbara Sampson, did not provide details but said \u201cno significant trauma\u201d was involved in the death of the woman, Malaysia Goodson. She said the cause of Ms. Goodson\u2019s death had not yet been determined. Ms. Goodson\u2019s daughter Rhylee, who was tucked in the stroller, survived.\n\nMalaysia had been healthy all her life, including the past year after the birth of Rhylee, Tamika Goodson, her mother, said. She said she was awaiting word on an autopsy. \u201cI need to know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out. If there\u2019s anything, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d\n\nWhatever the circumstances that resulted in Ms. Goodson ending up at the bottom of the stairs, her death shaped an anguished dialogue about life in New York City \u2014 about how people so rarely offer to lend a hand to those with strollers, about how so many subway stations lack elevators, about how the elevators in stations that have them are so often broken and about how the limitations of the city\u2019s old and creaking transportation system create obstacles, not just for people with small children but for older passengers and people with disabilities.",

She said the cause of Ms. Goodson\u2019s death had not yet been determined. Ms. Goodson\u2019s daughter Rhylee, who was tucked in the stroller, survived.\n\nMalaysia had been healthy all her life, including the past year after the birth of Rhylee, Tamika Goodson, her mother, said. She said she was awaiting word on an autopsy. \u201cI need to know,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out. If there\u2019s anything, we\u2019re going to find out.\u201d\n\nWhatever the circumstances that resulted in Ms. Goodson ending up at the bottom of the stairs, her death shaped an anguished dialogue about life in New York City \u2014 about how people so rarely offer to lend a hand to those with strollers, about how so many subway stations lack elevators, about how the elevators in stations that have them are so often broken and about how the limitations of the city\u2019s old and creaking transportation system create obstacles, not just for people with small children but for older passengers and people with disabilities.",
